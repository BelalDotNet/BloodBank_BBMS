Project Description :

The purpose of the blood bank management system is to simplify and automate the process of
searching for blood in case of emergency and maintain the records of blood donors, Patient,
blood donation programs and blood stocks in the bank. 

The Bondon Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a
web-based database application system that is to be used by the blood banks or blood centers as a
means to advertise the nation wide blood donation Camp to the public and at the same time
allow the public to make online Registration and request for the blood.
The system keeps the record of all the donors, Patient, blood donation Camp and the blood stock
in the blood bank. 

Although I have tried my level best on my project but there are some weakpoints that 
I am trying to overcome as soon as possible such as blood stock management properly, Rejected blood record, 
Expired Blood Notification And many more.
